### How it works?

After the user grants microphone permissions, a website redirect button of your choice is released to distract the target while small audio files (about 4 seconds in mp3 format) are sent to the attacker.
It uses Recorderjs, plugin for recording/exporting the output of Web Audio API nodes (https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs)

### Features:

Port Forwarding using Serveo or Ngrok
